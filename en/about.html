        <h1>How it works</h1>
            <h2>Data</h2>
                The client-side downloads data from <a href="https://github.com/kukosek/czech-covid-db"> czech-covid-db github</a>. This repository is updated by <a href="https://github.com/kukosek/czech-covid-db-multiparser"> czech-covid-db-multiparser </a>, which checks the wikipedia article <a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemie_COVID-19_v_%C4%8Cesku">Pandemie COVID-19 v Česku</a> and <a href="https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19"> official website of the Ministry of Health </a>every minute to see if the numbers are changed. If it detects some information is changed, it stores it as a record in a .csv table, which it then sends to github.

                <br><b>Official dataset</b>
                    Since 7.4. we use only the official data for czechia. The wikipedia dataset on czech-covid-db is still updated.
                <p>
                    <b>Edit 22.3.</b>: We now support the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">world-wide dataset</a> from Johns Hopkins University.
                </p>
            <h2>Growth factor</h2>
                <p>
                    Our growth factor differs from the commonly used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number"> R<sub>0</sub> factor </a>. While the the R<sub>0</sub> factor used by epidemiologists indicates how many people does an infected person inficate <b>in the infection period</b>, the growth factor we use indicates how many people does an infected person infect in <b>  one day</b>.
                </p>
                <i>
                f(x) = Number of confirmed cases in day "x"<br>
                t = The number of day we want to calculate the growth factor for<br>
                T = Infection period (phase, when an infected person infects other people and he still isn't quarantined)<br>

                    If <i>t-T+(0,1,2,3,...)</i> is smaller than 0, then <i>f(t-T+(0,1,2,3,...))</i> is replaced by 0.

                        Growth factor from wholes doesn't exclude people, who aren't arleady quarantined and isn't suitable for prediction.

            <h2>Prediction</h2>
                <p>
                    The default prediction parameters are based on our own current estimates (we do that only for czech republic prediction). We are not epidemiologists, so I recommend trying to set your own parameters. Then you can save the configuration and bet with your friend who will hit the result better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prediction calculation doesn't start in today, but in day 0.
                </p>
                <h4>Prediction with continuos growth factor according to growth factor chart</h4>

                        The growth factor for each calculation is updated to the value from the growth factor graph. The configuration of the growth factor graph is also reflected in the forecast.

                <h4>Henry's first epidemic function (Logistic)</h4>
                <div class="functionDescription">

                    It is essentially a recurrent relation of an exponential sequence that does not grow to infinity, but only to a certain maximum, thereby slowing its growth towards the end again by eliminating the possibility of infecting people who are already or have been previously infected. At the same time, it expects that infected people are contagious only for a certain period of time. It does not take mortality into account, the possibility of re-infection after recovering and the biggest problem of this function is that it does not exclude the possibility of multiple infections of the same person in one day.
                </div>
                <h4>Henry's second epidemic function (Probabilistic)</h4>
                <div class="functionDescription">
                    <img class="mathExpressionImg" src="/images/predpis_Henryova-druha.png"></img><br>
                    Due to many problems of the first function, which are difficult to tune, a slightly different approach is chosen in this case. The function calculates the likelihood of a person becoming infected on a given day, which then increases with the average number of people that he meets per day. This probability is then multiplied by the number of healthy people and the result is how many people were infected that day.
                    <p>
                        <br><b>Probability of getting infected</b><br>
                        <img class="mathExpressionImg" src="/images/pravdepodobnost_Henryova-druha.png"></img><br>
                        This is used to calculate the chance you got infected today.
                    </p>

                <b>To our surprise, both functions eventually return almost the same results.</b>
